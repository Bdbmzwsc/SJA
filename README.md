# Scratch JSON Analyser
Analyze files saved in Scratch3.0
The SJA here developed by himself, but the official SJA not I write, [website](https://gitee.com/gitkunkun/SJA),I am only interested in this project and using c # write SJA

# Synopsis
Scratch is a graphical programming language developed by MIT (currently No. 24 on the tiobe list), mainly for teenagers. The more famous communities are Kata, alpha camp, etc.

Scratch JSON analyzer, abbreviated as SJA, is a comparison tool for scratch3 JSON files initiated by Gu Yan. The original scratch version was released in camp a (alpha camp). In order to respond to users' requirements for file analysis and comparison and solve the problem of low efficiency of the original analyzer, it is decided to use Python to write this project.

SJA mainly has two functions: code structure analysis and file similarity analysis.

# principle
After the scratch3 file is opened in ZIP format, there will be a project.json file.

The program analyzes this file to count the number of code blocks and other information.

#  needs
[.Net Framework4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
Or directly run the EXE program inside. If. Net framework 4.7 has been installed on your computer, there will be no error. After the error is reported, click Yes, Then . Net framework download website required by the program will be opened
