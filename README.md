# SJA将被重写
# SJA will be overwritten

## 为什么重写
## Why to rewrite

原SJA结构和内容已不能继续更新、满足高版本的需求
The original SJA structure and content can not continue to update, meet the needs of high version

## 这次重写将会更新什么?
## What this rewrite will update?

### 构架和功能
```更新sja构架,并添加文件管理功能```
### 安全性
```在每次分析对比完后会生成一个报告，此报告将会被加密，对于分析项目也会对其进行加密，防止内容被篡改```
```防止利用外挂等手段去破解sja```
```加壳```
### UI
```此次重写UI将会比以前稍微好一点点```
### UWP
```可能会出现sjauwp版```

## What will this rewrite update?

## What this rewrite will update?

### Architecture and function

```Update SJA framework and add file management function```

### Security

```After each analysis and comparison, a report will be generated, which will be encrypted, and the analysis items will also be encrypted to prevent the contents from being tampered with```

```Prevent the use of plug-ins and other means to crack SJA```

```Shell```

### UI

```This rewrite of the UI will be a little better than before```

### UWP

```Sjauwp version may appear```


# Scratch JSON Analyser
Analyze files saved in Scratch3.0
The SJA here developed by himself, but the official SJA not I write, [website](https://gitee.com/gitkunkun/SJA),I am only interested in this project and using c # write SJA

# Synopsis
Scratch is a graphical programming language developed by MIT (currently No. 24 on the tiobe list), mainly for teenagers. The more famous communities are Kata, alpha camp, etc.

Scratch JSON analyzer, abbreviated as SJA, is a comparison tool for scratch3 JSON files initiated by Gu Yan. The original scratch version was released in camp a (alpha camp). In order to respond to users' requirements for file analysis and comparison and solve the problem of low efficiency of the original analyzer, it is decided to use Python to write this project.

SJA mainly has two functions: code structure analysis and file similarity analysis.

# principle
After the scratch3 file is opened in ZIP format, there will be a project.json file.

The program analyzes this file to count the number of code blocks and other information.

#  needs
[.Net Framework4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
Or directly run the EXE program inside. If. Net framework 4.7 has been installed on your computer, there will be no error. After the error is reported, click Yes, Then . Net framework download website required by the program will be opened
